# fino

a functional programming language with some fine features

notably,
- local type inference
- structural types
- typeclasses
- equirecursive types
- refinement types
- user-defined operators

only type inference and user-defined operators are implemented at the moment,
also temporarily nominal adts (i.e. rust enums) as well but that's just because
i don't know how to implement equirecursive structural types yet
