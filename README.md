# fino

a functional programming language with some fine features

notably,
- local type inference
- nominal types
- isorecursive types
- typeclasses
- user-defined operators

only type inference and user-defined operators are implemented at the moment
ideally we would have equirecursive structural types instead of isorecursive
nominal types but i don't know how to implement those (yet)
